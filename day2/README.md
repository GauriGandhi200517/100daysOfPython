# Day 2 of 100 Days of Python Challenge
Welcome to Day 2 of the 100 Days of Python Challenge! Today, we will be working on five exciting programs:

## 1. Jarvis 🤖

Jarvis is a simple voice assistant program that can perform various tasks such as opening applications, searching the web, and more. It uses the `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3` libraries to recognize and respond to voice commands.

## 2. Love Calculator 💖

The Love Calculator is a fun program that calculates the compatibility between two people based on their names. It uses a simple algorithm to generate a compatibility percentage.

## 3. Face Recognition Program (Haar Cascade Algorithm) 📸

This program uses the Haar Cascade algorithm to detect faces in images or video streams. The `opencv-python` library is used to implement the face detection functionality.

## 4. Flappy Bird Game 🐦

The Flappy Bird game is a clone of the popular mobile game. It is created using the `pygame` library and involves controlling a bird to navigate through obstacles without crashing.

## 5. Snake Game with Emojis 🐍🍎

In this program, we will design a classic Snake game using the `pygame` library. Additionally, we will use emojis to represent the snake and the food items, making the game more visually appealing.

I also added handwritten notes to the notes folder.

Stay tuned for more exciting projects in the upcoming days of the challenge!

Happy Coding! 🎉
