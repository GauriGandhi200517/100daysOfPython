Welcome to Day 6 of the 100 Days of Python challenge! Today, we will be diving into the topic of **Variables and Data Types**.

## Variables 📝

Variables are used to store information that can be referenced and manipulated in a program. They are essential for writing dynamic and flexible code.

### Declaring Variables

In Python, you can declare a variable by simply assigning a value to it using the `=` operator:

```python
# Example of variable declaration
name = "Alice"
age = 30
height = 5.5
```

## Data Types 📊

Data types specify the type of data that a variable can hold. Python has several built-in data types, including:

1. **Integers**: Whole numbers without a decimal point.
    ```python
    age = 30
    ```

2. **Floats**: Numbers with a decimal point.
    ```python
    height = 5.5
    ```

3. **Strings**: Sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
    ```python
    name = "Alice"
    ```

4. **Booleans**: Represents `True` or `False` values.
    ```python
    is_student = True
    ```

5. **Lists**: Ordered collection of items.
    ```python
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    ```

6. **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable collection of items.
    ```python
    coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
    ```

7. **Dictionaries**: Collection of key-value pairs.
    ```python
    person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
    ```

## Example Code 💻

Here is an example that demonstrates the use of different data types:

```python
# Variable declarations
name = "Alice"
age = 30
height = 5.5
is_student = True
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

# Output the variables
print(f"Name: {name}")
print(f"Age: {age}")
print(f"Height: {height}")
print(f"Is Student: {is_student}")
print(f"Fruits: {fruits}")
print(f"Coordinates: {coordinates}")
print(f"Person: {person}")
```

Happy coding! 🚀
