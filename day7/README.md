# Day 7 of 100 Days of Python Challenge 🐍

## Exercise 1:- calculator using python🐍

Welcome to Day 7 of the 100 Days of Python Challenge! 🎉

Today, we will dive into the world of operators in Python. Operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Let's explore the different types of operators and focus on arithmetic operators in detail.

## Types of Operators

1. **Arithmetic Operators**
2. **Comparison Operators**
3. **Logical Operators**
4. **Bitwise Operators**
5. **Assignment Operators**
6. **Identity Operators**
7. **Membership Operators**

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations. Here are the arithmetic operators available in Python:

1. **Addition (`+`)**
    - Adds two operands.
    - Example: `3 + 2` results in `5`.

2. **Subtraction (`-`)**
    - Subtracts the second operand from the first.
    - Example: `5 - 2` results in `3`.

3. **Multiplication (`*`)**
    - Multiplies two operands.
    - Example: `4 * 3` results in `12`.

4. **Division (`/`)**
    - Divides the first operand by the second.
    - Example: `10 / 2` results in `5.0`.

5. **Modulus (`%`)**
    - Returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second.
    - Example: `7 % 3` results in `1`.

6. **Exponentiation (`**`)**
    - Raises the first operand to the power of the second.
    - Example: `2 ** 3` results in `8`.

7. **Floor Division (`//`)**
    - Divides the first operand by the second and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result.
    - Example: `9 // 2` results in `4`.
