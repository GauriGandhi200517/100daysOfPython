# 🐍 Day 28 of 100 Days of Python: Introduction to f-Strings 🎉

Welcome to Day 28 of the **100 Days of Python Challenge**! Today, we explored the powerful and concise **f-strings** in Python. 🚀

## 📚 What are f-Strings?

f-Strings, introduced in Python 3.6, are a modern and efficient way to format strings. They allow you to embed expressions directly inside string literals by prefixing the string with an `f` or `F`.

### ✨ Key Features of f-Strings:
- **Readable and concise**: Embed variables and expressions directly in the string.
- **Supports expressions**: Perform calculations or call functions inside the string.
- **Improved performance**: Faster than older formatting methods like `%` or `.format()`.

### 🛠️ Syntax:
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```

### 🧪 Example:
```python
# Variables
name = "John"
score = 95

# Using f-strings
print(f"Congratulations, {name}! You scored {score} points. 🎉")

# Inline expressions
print(f"Next year, {name} will be {score + 1} years old!")
```
