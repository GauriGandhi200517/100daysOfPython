# Day 4 of 100 Days of Python 🐍

## Our First Python Program

Welcome to Day 4 of the 100 Days of Python challenge! Today, we will write our very first Python program using the `print` function. 🎉

### The `print` Function

The `print` function is one of the most commonly used functions in Python. It allows you to display output to the console. Here is a simple example:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

When you run this code, it will output:

```
Hello, World!
```

### How It Works

- The `print` function takes one or more arguments and prints them to the console.
- You can pass strings, numbers, or even variables to the `print` function.
- By default, `print` adds a newline character at the end of the output, so each call to `print` will appear on a new line.

### Attached Notes 📎

Please refer to the attached notes for more detailed explanations and additional examples. These notes will help you understand the `print` function better and provide you with more practice exercises.

Happy coding! 🚀
